Offa was the King of Mercia from 757 until his death in July 796.
The DNA from a single (diploid) human cell if the 46 chromosomes were connected end-to-end and straightened, would have a length of ~2 m and a width of ~2.4 nanometers.
Most viruses that have been studied have a diameter between 20 and 300 nanometres.
Valencia is the capital of the autonomous community of Valencia and the third largest city in Spain after Madrid and Barcelona, with a population of 809,267 within its administrative limits on a land area of 134.6 km2 (52 sq mi).
There was armour 6 or 7 inches (150 to 180 mm) thick along the side of the hull and over the gunhouses, whereas Dreadnought's armour was 11 inches (280 to 300 mm) at its thickest.
These ships were designed to carry twelve 14-inch (360 mm) guns, with armour up to 12 inches (300 mm) thick, and a speed of 26.6 knots (49.3 km/h).
The whole car, including engine, fluids and driver, weighs only 640 kg (1411 lbs)—the minimum weight set by the regulations.
Consequently, the driver's head is pulled sideways with a force equivalent to the weight of 20 kg in corners.
A regulation football is 720–730 millimetres (28–29 in) in circumference, and 545–555 mm (21.5–21.9 in) transverse circumference, and inflated to a pressure of 62–76 kPa (9.0–11.0 psi).
As with most other SI unit symbols (angle symbols, e.g. 45°3′4″, are the exception) there is a space between the numeric value and the kelvin symbol (e.g. "99.987 K").
Later, other scientists decided to redefine the degree slightly to make the freezing point exactly 32 °F, and the boiling point exactly 212 °F or 180 degrees higher.
This is roughly equivalent to 5.3 billion troy ounces or, in terms of volume, about 8500 m3, or a cube 20.4 m on a side.
Thirty-six radioisotopes have been synthesized ranging in atomic mass from 169 to 205.
Because ore grades of 30 mg/kg (30 ppm) are usually needed before gold is visible to the naked eye, in most gold mines the gold is invisible.
Electric water boilers have a built in thermostat that detects when water has reached its boiling point of 100 °C (212 °F) to automatically shut off.
A kilogram of uranium-235 (U-235) converted via nuclear processes releases approximately three million times more energy than a kilogram of coal burned conventionally (7.2 × 10^13 joules per kilogram of uranium-235 versus 2.4 × 10^7 joules per kilogram of coal).
After King Frederick Augustus III of Saxony had abdicated on 13 November 1918, Saxony, remaining a constituent state of Germany (Weimar Republic), became a republic renamed the Free State of Saxony following the new Saxon constitution of 1 November 1920.
The hottest day on record was the 9th August, 1992 with a high of 38.8 °C, the coldest was the 14th January, 1987 with −24.1 °C.
Gustav Mahler was second conductor (working under Artur Nikisch) at the Leipzig Theater from June 1886 until May 1888, and achieved his first great recognition while there by completing and publishing Carl Maria von Weber's opera Die Drei Pintos, and Mahler also completed his own 1st Symphony while living there.
The density of steel varies based on the alloying constituents but usually ranges between 7,750 and 8,050 kg/m3 (484 and 503 lb/cu ft), or 7.75 and 8.05 g/cm3 (4.48 and 4.65 oz/cu in).
This confluence, at an elevation of 5,043 feet (1,537 m), is also the junction of two naturally formed routes across the mountains of central Utah.
The last train to pass through downtown Thistle was the westbound Rio Grande Zephyr, on April 14, 1983 at about 8:30 p.m.
The engineering firm employed by the Rio Grande claimed their studies indicated the crown of the landslide was about 300 feet (90 m) above the level of the tracks, and did not know the true size of the unstable area until the slide was in motion.
To expedite construction, the railroad had crews in Utah focused on grading the new path and boring a 3,000-foot (910 m) tunnel, while crews in Colorado built track segments that were transported to site.
Except for the spring months, precipitation averages less than 2 inches (5.1 cm) per month.
Deeply weathered profiles are widespread on the continental landmasses between latitudes 35°N and 35°S.
The distributions of gold and calcium carbonate or calcium magnesium carbonates are closely correlated and documented in the southern Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia, in the top 1 to 2 m (3.3 to 6.6 ft) of the soil profile and locally as deep as 5 m (16 ft).
In this universe, some thermal energy δQ from the warmer room surroundings (at 298 K or 25 °C) will spread out to the cooler system of ice and water at its constant temperature T of 273 K (0 °C), the melting temperature of ice.
It is important to realize that the decrease in the entropy of the surrounding room is less than the increase in the entropy of the ice and water: the room temperature of 298 K is larger than 273 K and therefore the ratio, (entropy change), of δQ/298 K for the surroundings is smaller than the ratio (entropy change), of δQ/273 K for the ice+water system.
He claimed to be able to measure temperatures to within 1⁄200 of a degree Fahrenheit (3 mK).
